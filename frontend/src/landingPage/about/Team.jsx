          Hi, I’m <strong>Mangesh Wahatule</strong>. I’m passionate about
          technology, finance, and building solutions that empower people to
          invest and trade with confidence. With a background in software
          development and a deep interest in financial markets, I created AstreX
          to make trading simple, transparent, and accessible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding or designing new features, I enjoy exploring
          market trends, learning about emerging fintech innovations, and
          helping others understand investing.
